A program simulating changing between lanes for a Car

This repository contains coursework for 2018 course within Test and Verification. The program simulates a scenario where a Car is placed on a street of length 100 units, and 3 lanes across. The Car is supposed to be capable of performing a few basic functions such as moving forward, changing between lanes, checking traffic across next lane etc. 

A number of sensors (4 RADARS + 1 LIDAR) are programmed on the car simulating different cases in the adjacent left lane and the car acts based on incoming data from these sensors when asked to switch lanes. 

A number of test cases written using JUnit are also provided to test for points of failure and functionality.

This solution is a collective effort of successful collaboration between the following students on the previously mentioned course:

Anita Pourferdosi,
Alexander Gustafsson,
Ahmed Nuur,
Pushpendra U.
